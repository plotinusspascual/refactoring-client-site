# Refactoring Client Site

## Project Overview

Given the client's (Horiseon) website, I was tasked to refactor their existing code to meet a certain set of standards and to implement a new technology that is more practiced in front end web development. 

The major goal in this project is to implement web accessibility within the website to ensure that people with disablilities can access the website using assistive technologies. 

I have improved the codebase for long term sustainability by seperating non semantic html elements and converting them to their own sementic elements. In doing so, the code is easier to read and change, as well as editing an element individually and not as a group of elements.
